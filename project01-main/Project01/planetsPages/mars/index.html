        <h2>About Mars</h2>
        <p class="text">
          ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world
          with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with
          seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that
          it was even more active in the past. Mars is one of the most explored
          bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent
          rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA currently has two rovers
          (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
          (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. Perseverance rover – the
          largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched
          down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293
          million miles (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode
          to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance. Perseverance is one of
          three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from
          the United Arab Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1
          mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an orbiter, a lander,
          and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from
          orbit. In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land
          successfully on Mars when its Zhurong Mars rover touched down. An
          international fleet of eight orbiters is studying the Red Planet from
          above including three NASA orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars
          Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN. These robotic explorers have found
          lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker
          atmosphere, billions of years ago.
