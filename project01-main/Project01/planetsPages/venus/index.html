        <h2>About Venus</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest
          planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky)
          planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in
          size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are
          radical differences between the two worlds. Venus has a thick, toxic
          atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in
          thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a
          runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar
          system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures
          on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot
          enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered
          with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes.
          Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active. Venus
          has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of
          Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean
          on Earth. Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its
          axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar
          system. This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets
          in the east, opposite to what we experience on Earth. (It’s not the
          only planet in our solar system with such an oddball rotation – Uranus
          spins on its side.)
