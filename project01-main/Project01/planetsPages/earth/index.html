        <h2>About Earth</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place
          we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. While Earth is
          only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only
          world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just
          slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
          planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
          The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except
          for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
          However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the
          ground.”
